## Notes

I had brief issues with the key to go to Step 3/7 and joined the Slack PREWORK-102 workspace for assistance. I also
had to read the MDN docs for the .appendChild() method. Overall, this experience was very helpful (taught me a lot about raw Javascript) and I'd recommend completing PREWORK to anyone who's interested in web dev (even those who are
not applying to the actual WEB102 course).

I also had a lot of fun with the bonus features (particularly the surprise me button!).
